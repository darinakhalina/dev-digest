# client — @devdigest/web

Next.js 15 studio UI. The root `CLAUDE.md` applies; this adds client-only rules.

## Use when

- Adding a page or a hook, or wiring to the API → read `README.md` (route map → hooks → `api.ts`)
- Moving the Server/Client boundary, adding a query key or an invalidation, touching the live-run
  stream, or importing a contract as a value → read `docs/01-ui-architecture.md`
- Adding or changing a UI component → read `src/vendor/ui/README.md`, then add it to `/showcase`
- Implementing a feature → read its spec in `specs/`; write one first if it is missing. A feature
  that also needs the server goes in the repository-root `specs/` instead
- Changing how findings are counted, filtered or previewed on a PR page → read
  `specs/2026-09-21-findings-severity-filter.md` first: it states which of that behaviour is a
  promise and how each promise is checked
- Something surprised you, or a fix was not obvious → `INSIGHTS.md`, through the
  `engineering-insights` skill, which carries the format and the rules
- Need depth the README does not give → `docs/`

## Rules not visible from any single file

- Pages are thin. Feature logic lives in the route's `_components/<Name>/` — PascalCase folder and
  file, with a colocated `*.test.tsx`.
- Relative imports have **no** extension here (`from "./core"`), unlike `server` and
  `reviewer-core` — Next bundles this code, it does not run as raw ESM.
- Data flows only through `src/lib/hooks/*` → `src/lib/api.ts` (TanStack Query). No `fetch` in components.
- UI primitives come only from the `@devdigest/ui` barrel — never import a layer file directly.
  Colors come from CSS variables, never hard-coded.
- User-facing strings live in `messages/en/<area>.json` (next-intl), not inline in JSX.
- Contracts come from `src/vendor/shared`, which can lag the server's copy. When a type looks wrong,
  diff it against `server/src/vendor/shared`. Values (Zod schemas, not just types) import from the
  same barrel and bundle correctly only because `next.config.mjs` sets `resolve.extensionAlias` —
  the vendored files carry the server's `.js` specifiers. Do not remove it.

## Commands (client-only)

```sh
pnpm dev          # :3000
pnpm test         # vitest + jsdom, fetch mocked — needs neither API nor browser
pnpm typecheck
pnpm build        # the only check that exercises the bundler — see below
```

`typecheck` and `test` both resolve a `./x.js` specifier to `x.ts` themselves; the bundler does
not. A broken import therefore stays green in both and fails only in `pnpm build` or `pnpm dev`.
Run one of those before calling client work done.

**Stop `pnpm dev` before `pnpm build`.** They share `.next`, so a build run against a live dev
server overwrites its chunks and the page then dies with `Cannot find module
'./vendor-chunks/…'` — an error that names a dependency and says nothing about the cause.
Recover by deleting `.next` and starting `dev` again.

Env: `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE` (default `http://localhost:3001`).
